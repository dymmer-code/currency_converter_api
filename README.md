> [!WARNING]
> Well, there's a day where everything free is not free anymore or it's closed. The free side of this service was shutdown time ago and looks like it's not going back. If you are able to pay for getting the service it's up to you. But since I don't use it I see non sense to keep maintaining this library so, you are on your own, I wish you the best of luck!

# CurrencyConvertApi

Implementation for the API available in this site: https://free.currencyconverterapi.com

This uses [Tesla]() library to make easier the access to the endpoint and [Nebulex]() for the cache and avoid to perform so many queries to the service.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `currency_convert_api` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:currency_convert_api, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/currency_convert_api](https://hexdocs.pm/currency_convert_api).

## Usage

```elixir
CurrencyConverterApi.convert_call "USD", "EUR"
#Â 0.876545

Enjoy!
